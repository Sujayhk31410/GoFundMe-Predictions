## Background
Crowdfunding platforms like GoFundMe help people raise funds for personal or community needs. However, many campaigns struggle to meet their goals. This project aims to address two key questions:
1. What factors influence the success of a campaign?
2. Can we predict how much a campaign will raise?

## Features
Key features include:
- Campaign goal and duration
- Story text metrics (length, sentiment, complexity)
- Organizer location and category
- Image analysis (emotion, age group, etc.)

## Model and Methodology
- **Supervised Learning**: Regression to predict raised amount.
- **Key Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and SVM.
- **Tools**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas), NLP libraries, Face++ API.
